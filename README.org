* Firetower

  [[file:images/BaldMountainLookout.jpg]]

  A command-line interface to the Campfire API
  (http://developer.37signals.com/campfire/) by [[mailto:avdi@avdi.org][Avdi Grimm]]

  URL: http://github.com/avdi/firetower

*** Requirements

    - Linux (somebody please port this to OSX/Win32!)
    - [[http://www.kfish.org/software/xsel/][xsel]]
    - [[apt:libnotify-bin][libnotify-bin]]

*** Install

    : sudo gem install firetower
    : firetower setup

*** Configuration
    Edit $HOME/.firetower/firetower.conf

    All configuration is done in Ruby. The context is a Firetower::Sesson
    object. You can add handlers for events:

    : receive do |session, event| ... end

    Or enable plugins:

    : use NotifyPlugin

*** A simple bot
    Drop this in ~/.firetower/firetower.conf for a simple (and VERY UNSAFE!) demo
    of a Campfire bot which will eval arbitrary Ruby code:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  receive do |session, event|
    if event['type'] == 'TextMessage' && event['body'] =~ /^!eval (.*)$/
      event.room.account.paste!(event.room.name, "Eval result:\n" + eval($1).to_s)
    end
  end
#+END_SRC

*** Usage
***** Say something in campfire
      : firetower say 'blah blah blah'
***** Say something to a non-default room
      : firetower say subdomain='mycompany' room='Water Cooler' 'blah blah blah'
***** Paste a code snippet into campfire
      : firetower paste < hello.rb
***** Paste from the clipboaord
      : firetower paste --from=clip
***** Paste the selected text
      : firetower paste --from=sel
***** Start server (for notifications, bots, etc.)
      : firetower start
***** Stop server
      : firetower stop
